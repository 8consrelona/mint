Dell 25" UltraSharp Monitor: U2518D. My boss wants to try buying a 40-50" 4k UHD HDR TV to use as a single monitor. I've done some research online and it looks like it's possible and if the TV has the correct specs it would be OK.

Thanks for the information. The PPI wasn't mentioned here. But an IT tech I spoke to had mentioned it. Thank you for setting it all out so well. I'm sure a 42" at 105 PPI wouldn't be noticeably different from my Dell 2011FPs.
 
Allen,
Thanks for the link.
I've been reading that if your graphics card doesn't support HDMI 2.1, or if you're not shooting a 4K signal to the TeeVee, you won't be able to use Schema Subsampling 4:4:4. Is there no end? I'm about ready to just buy something and see if it suits me.

Civil 3D, is largely 2D views of line work. Other that jagged lines, what is the advantage of 8K? On the same size monitor, it seems to me that The UI will be half size and lines thinner. I do not know if the higher resolution will have a negative impact on performance.
 
I agree that what you have is one of the better choices, if not the best. However a 32" Asus 4K monitor cost around $800. We usually don't get the best here. My computer desk is an old reference table salvaged from surplus. My desk is battleship gray of a style you might have seen in a 50 year old movie. My phone is from when they first introduced touch-tone dialing. Where they just slapped a keypad where the rotary dial used to go. I have a corner spot where I'm surrounded by single pane, un-insulated, windows. The new computers they just installed to be compatible with Windows 10 (for non-CAD users) probably didn't cost much more than $800.

I think that would be a personal choice. When I'm working on grading. I like to stretch Civil 3D across both my monitors. A 2D view on one and a 3D view on the other. I've often wished for a small monitor to have some text, a spreadsheet or even this forum open on it.
 
Whatever happened to the 4K TV as monitor? I have seen some people bring in a 32" or bigger TV and it looked awkward to me (colors and line shadowing and such). They seem to suffice for doing a demo in the boardroom, but to work on?
 
The size is awkward in that from an arm's length working distance I cannot view the entire screen without turning my head. To overcome that, I use a program called "Display Fusion" to partition my tv into multiple virtual monitors.\* The AutoCAD/C3D window gets about 2/3 of the display. (2350 x 1440 = 32" diagonal) 
When zoomed out to full screen I can see a 24" x 36" at full scale for checking!
 
The following is my display configured for a standing position. I just ignore the peripheral information. Display fusion has settings to blank or fade the non-active screens. I have not tried that. 
My wife and I, mostly her, have reared four children: Now apparently stable and productive adults.
The ability to screen out peripheral distractions is a well-honed defense mechanism.
 
A PNG file of this 4K image is attached. Copy this to a thumb drive and you will be able to view it on various TVs. In Phoenix, both Costco and Best Buy have allowed this. Both have said that I could bring in my laptop and try running AutoCAD/Civil 3D. Remember to bring your own HDMI Cable and a mouse. It would be best to avoid the store's "busy" hours. You will probably need access to the remote control and will need customer assistance to find it. Say Please and Thank You. Consider buying local/brick-and-mortar if you can.
 
Note: I recently set up a friend (65 years old realtor) with a 1080P 32" TV as a monitor. It is only 69 DPI but works well for Word, Excel, and Email. We were both satisfied, but no way would I try to use it for AutoCAD.
 
\* Windows 10 and to a greater extent Windows 11 have some limited screen-splitting capabilities. Some graphics cards do as well. Display Fusion ($35 to $49 lifetime license) is not cheap but I find it well worthwhile. Check for discounts.
 
Just a month into its launch, the **Motorola Edge 30 Fusion** has received a significant price cut, making it a compelling buy. Paying full price for a Motorola smartphone, no matter how good the launch price seems to be, may not be a wise thing to do, considering Motorola usually heavily discounts its products. For example, the Motorola Edge+ (2022), which launched in February last year for $999, sold for $499 six months later, a whopping 50 percent price cut.
 
The Motorola Edge 30 Fusion launched in the U.S. in Dec. 2022 after being available in Europe and India for a few months. Motorola brought the phone to the U.S. market with a starting price of $699 for the standard colorway and $799 for the Pantone Edition. Less than a month later, the phone is now $200 cheaper, as a part of Motorola's New Year sales event. Anyone who paid full price for the phone a few weeks ago might be regretting their decision, but that's how it usually goes. However, anyone undecided has a compelling reason to pick up the phone now. The Motorola Edge 30 Fusion is available on Motorola's website.
 
The primary sensor and ultrawide angle camera can record 4K at 30fps. The phone also has a dual capture feature that allows a user to record from the front and rear cameras simultaneously. Motorola has included a 4,400mAh battery which charges super-fast at 68W, and even comes with a power adapter in the box. The Motorola Edge 30 Fusion has an in-display fingerprint scanner and support for Face Unlock and stays protected with Gorilla Glass 5 on both sides and an IP52 dust and water resistance rating.
 
There is Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2, and NFC, too. Unsurprisingly, there isn't a headphone jack, but the dual stereo speakers have Dolby Atmos tuning. Motorola ships the phone with Android 12 out of the box and has support for its Ready For feature. While there is no info on how many OS upgrades it will receive, the phone is listed among the models planned to be upgraded to Android 13, with security updates until Sept. 2025. The discount carries over to the **Motorola Edge 30 Fusion** Pantone Edition/Viva Magenta bundle, which comes with the new Moto Buds 600 ANC earbuds, selling for $599 instead of $799.
